# playwright-todo-demo
This a test repository to work with Playwright and test against the Playwright todo MVC demo project. This is a publicly available website which can be 
found at https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/#/

# purpose
The purpose of this project is to get an understanding how Playwright works and familiarize myself with the basic syntax and functionality of the framework. 
Some the code used is for experience with Playwright and not necessarily how I would write/organize code in a real project.
